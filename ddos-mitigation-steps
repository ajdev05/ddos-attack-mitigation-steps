Hello World! This is AJ.




The point of this project is to help people learn a little about DDoS attacks, also known as Distributed Denial of Service Attacks.




# Background

These types of cyber attacks happen every second on the internet, and it's annoying because you might
have heard that these types of attacks happen to big websites or that they only target big corporations' infrastructure,
but that's not true at all! . DDoS attacks can target anything that has a public IP address, for example: websites, any type of server
like a VPS server or game server, and people’s home WiFi. My first experience with this type of attack was when I was playing Xbox, yes Xbox! 
At that time, Xbox had not implemented the use of dedicated servers on the Xbox Live party chat platform, and all the communication was done 
peer-to-peer. So, if you were a bad guy on the internet and someone beat you in a video game, you could simply use a network monitoring tool 
like Wireshark to capture traffic over UDP protocol and see all of the IP addresses of everyone in your Xbox Live party.After that, well, you know 
what happened. The bad guy would either scare you off or he would try to overflood your router with invalid packets or a DDoS/DoS attack, which would
result in your router trying to manage all of the incoming traffic and eventually it would deauth itself and you would have no internet.




# DDoS vs. DoS


A DoS, or Denial of Service, attack is when a single party or a single device tries to send you requests or packets 
to overwhelm your server of any type. These types of attacks are usually UDP protocol-based attacks. From my experience 
and testing on my servers, DoS attacks are usually not effective anymore against big infrastructure hosting companies because
their basic firewalls are smart enough to ignore 2000 requests from one user, but some home Wifi connections can still be affected
by over-flooding packets. This is because maybe they are still using old networking equipment and their infrastructure is not smart 
enough to recognize a DoS attack.


# DDoS


 A Distributed Denial of Service attack, it's pretty self-explanatory, the attack is Distributed among other devices and together 
 they all attack a target. A DDoS attack is usually carried out by or with a BotNet. A BotNet is an army of computers controlled by a
 bad guy on the internet by putting malware on victims' devices, like computers, phones, and anything that has a connection to the internet 
 or Bluetooth. BotNet malware like worms can spread themselves through a network and infect all of the devices that are connected to the 
 internet and turn them into zombies or bots on a botnet. The bad guy has root access or full access to all of these devices, and the bad 
 guy controls and sends commands to these devices through a CNC, also known as C2, also known as Command and Control. In a DDoS attack, this 
 is what happens, when a BotNet user puts a command to launch a DDoS attack, that command goes to every device on that BotNet then instead of 
 one device sending packets to a target, all of the devices start to send packets to the target which results in a better and more successful
 deauthentication attack.



# Types of Attacks




ICMP flooding: The attacker floods a target with ICMP requests.




UDP flooding: The attacker floods a target with UDP requests.




SYN flooding: The attacker floods a target with TCP-based handshakes.




NTP flooding: The attacker floods a target with amplifed UDP packets.




HTTP flooding: The attacker floods a target with HTTP GET or POST requests to attack a web server or application.




Most IaaS that provide DDoS protection have most of these attacks patched or filtered, but there are still some ways that are unknown or new.




Zero-Day Attacks: Unknown attacks or different ways of attacking services




# "Mitigation Practices"




When there are two people talking at once, humans know to focus on one conversation and continue, but with computers, 
it's different because they can’t think like us and avoid bad talk.

Some ways to mitigate or dump traffic are:

All are Ubuntu/Debian-based.




UFW: Uncomplicated Firewall.

limiting port traffic to the whole server with UFW




Install UFW with apt install ufw

UFW comes preloaded on Ubuntu distributions.




To limit traffic commands

ufw allow from [your public IP address] to any port [your ssh port]

EG: ufw allow traffic from 192.186.22.12 to any port 22




Any traffic that's not from your IP address will go to your server's IP address and the port will be ignored.




With UFW, you can also implement iptables. Iptables is a built-in firewall for Linux. With iptables, you can set your firewall 
rules to ACCEPT or REJECT types of traffic from IPs, ports, protocols, etc. Sadly, I cannot cover IPTables fully. You may watch a
video to understand them better, but I will put my firewall rules on the Github repository.




When there is a DDoS attack, your server gets flooded with a lot of traffic from various different IP addresses, and one of the things 
that I like to do is to block IP subnets that have engaged and are trying to send requests to my server's IP address on the port. It's not
that common to see home service providers like Comcast, Charter, etc., send a lot of traffic to your server’s IP address and port because 
DDoS is against most of their policies and also because people are also getting smarter by not opening miscellaneous files on their computers, 
and many computers come with anti-virus software that prevents that from happening. So, rather than wasting their time, most bot-masters/DDoS for
hire services, in my experience, use other VPS servers in their botnet to send attacks to targets. That's why it's good to block some cloud providers.
My file will be in the GitHub repository.




And this is it! If there are new things, I will be updating this GitHub repository.
